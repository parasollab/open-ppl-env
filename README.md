# Open PPL Environments

This repository houses the open-source Parasol Motion Planning Benchmarks. 
We intend for these benchmarks to be used to compare various motion planning algorithms. 
As such, these models are available for public, non-commercial use provided that appropriate reference is made to the source/creator of the model. 

If you have any models that you could contribute to this effort, please let us know and we will be happy to include them here.

Each directory in this repository contains an environment and an example xml file which can be used to run a motion planning scenario with PPL. We also include a README file in each directory that gives a visual and more information about that benchmark.
Also, visit [our website](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/resources/mpbenchmarks/) to see a high-level overview of each benchmark.

For instructions on downloading and compiling the Parasol Planning Library, see the [PPL GitLab repository](https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/parasol-group/parasol/open-ppl).
